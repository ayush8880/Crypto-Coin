# Crypto-Coin

This is a test crypto coin that I tried and made with the help of some resources. It is a very simple coin which can be run on the test network and can be minted only by the original contract owner's address.
There is also an error function which can detect if the someone tries to send more coins than they actually hold and also created an event 'sent' and emiting it in the 'send' function.
